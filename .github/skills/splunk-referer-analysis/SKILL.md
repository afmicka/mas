description: Analyze a Splunk LANA CSV export for one referer URL and decide whether the errors are an authoring issue or a code issue, with direct calls to action.
---

Analyze the Splunk LANA export attached / referenced in the request and classify the
errors on that referer page as an **authoring** issue (content fragment misconfigured)
or a **code** issue (io pipeline / merch-card / mas.js bug), then give direct,
actionable calls to action.

Input: `$ARGUMENTS` — a path to the CSV export (or it is attached to the message).

## What the data is

Each row is a client-side LANA event. The payload lives in `_raw` → JSON →
`log_message`, a `¦`-separated list of `key=value` pairs (`¶` precedes `page=` and
`facts=`). `facts` is a JSON array of per-fragment telemetry: `aem-fragment:status`,
`aem-fragment:serverTiming` (cdn-cache HIT/MISS/REVALIDATE), `aem-fragment:stale`,
`aem-fragment:retryCount`, `aem-fragment:etag`. The `message` field holds the
merch-card error text.

## Sampling — the counts are ~1% of reality

**Critical: every count in the parser output is a ~1% sample, not a headcount.** MAS
logs errors to LANA with `sampleRate: 1` (`web-components/src/lana.js`), and Milo's
lana treats `sampleRate` as a _percent_ — `sampleRate <= Math.random() * 100`
(`libs/utils/lana.js`), so roughly 1 in 100 client error events is actually forwarded
to Splunk. Info events (`errorType: 'i'`) use `implicitSampleRate: 1` — also ~1%.

Consequences for every number you report:

- **Scale up ~100×** for the real user-facing volume: a raw count of `k` ≈ `100·k`
  actual events. Always say "estimated" and give a round figure, never a false-precise
  one (`~64,000`, not `63,700`).
- **State the imprecision.** Relative uncertainty ≈ `1/√k`. So `k=600` is ±~4% (solid),
  `k=100` is ±~10%, `k=25` is ±~20%, and anything **below ~10 is not quantifiable** —
  report it as "seen, a handful of times" and never scale it to a headline number.
- The **verdict and classification never depend on scaling** — proportions between
  messages are unaffected by uniform sampling. Scaling only changes how you describe
  _magnitude/impact_. Do not let a scaled-up number inflate the severity of a
  low-count signal.
- Whenever you print a raw parser count, either scale it or flag it as a raw 1% sample.
  Never present a raw count as the number of affected users.

## Workflow

1. **Parse.** Run the bundled parser (do not re-implement it):

    ```sh
    python3 .github/skills/splunk-referer-analysis/parse_lana.py <csv>
    ```

    It emits JSON: event count, time range, referer(s), locales, an id-normalized
    message histogram, `card_ids`, `culprit_fragment_ids` (ids named inside the error
    text — the fragments to fix), and `fetched_fragments` (per-fragment fetch health).

2. **Classify** each dominant message with the decision table below.

3. **Verify** the top culprit fragment(s) against production before asserting a cause —
   fetch the live payload and inspect the field the code actually reads:

    ```sh
    curl -s "https://www.adobe.com/mas/io/fragment?id=<id>&api_key=wcms-commerce-ims-ro-user-milo&locale=<locale>" | python3 -m json.tool
    ```

    Compare the `etag` to the one in the report; check `fields.variant`, fetch status,
    `path`, `model`, and **`tags`**. A 200 + cdn HIT + stable etag means delivery is
    healthy and the fault is in the content or the client.

4. **Check whether the culprit is a variation** (see "Variations must never be served
   directly" below). This changes both the root cause and who owns the fix.

5. **Trace the referer's EDS/MEP source** when the error is a `merch-card` hydration
   failure but the live fragment looks field-only/headless (see "Headless / field-only
   fragment rendered as a card" below). This is what separates an authoring fault from a
   Milo autoblock/rollout fault — do it before you blame the author.

6. **Build a Studio link** for each culprit fragment so the author/engineer can open it
   in one click (see "Studio deep link" below).

7. **Report** in the output format below. Lead with the verdict. Present all volumes
   as sampling-scaled estimates per the "Sampling" section — never bare 1% counts.
   Whenever a human must fix content, the call to action is a Slack-ready message
   with human actions, cards to fix and sample pages (see "Whenever a human must act").

## Studio deep link

For every culprit fragment id, emit a link that opens it directly in the M@S Studio
fragment editor:

```
https://mas.adobe.com/studio.html#page=fragment-editor&fragmentId=<culprit-id>
```

(`page=fragment-editor` and `fragmentId` are the router's hash keys — `studio/src/mas-fragment-editor.js` `getFragmentEditorUrl`, `studio/src/router.js`. Everything lives after the `#`.) One link per `culprit_fragment_ids` entry; label it so a non-engineer knows it opens the card. This link is the one piece of "technical" output that **is** allowed in an AUTHORING report — it's the author's fix entry point, not jargon.

## Variations must never be served directly

**Core rule: a variation — promotion or grouped — must never be accessed directly.**
A variation is a partial overlay meant to be merged onto its base card; only the base
carries the card layout (`fields.variant`). So a variation served standalone has no
variant and hydration throws `no template found in payload`. **The missing variant is
the symptom; the root cause is that a variation is being rendered on its own** —
typically because MEP / personalization (or a hand-built link) points at the variation
id instead of the base card id.

Signals that the culprit fragment is a variation (from the live fetch, step 3):

- `path` sits under a `/promotions/<campaign>/` folder → **promotion variation**.
- `tags` include `mas:promotion/*` (promo) and/or `mas:pzn/*` (personalization target).
- Grouped variations follow the same rule — same fix, different origin.
- Corroborating (from the parser): `referer_query_keys` show campaign/paid-media
  markers (`sdid`, `mv2`, `gclid`, `mep`, …), consistent with a promo/MEP landing.

When these signals are present with a missing variant, classify the root cause as
**"a variation is being served directly"**, not "author forgot the layout". The fix is
to stop pointing at the variation (point MEP / the link at the base card so the overlay
merges correctly), and the recurring-risk note applies: any promo/grouped variation
reachable by a direct id is one MEP mistarget away from this same failure.

## Headless / field-only fragment rendered as a card

**A `no template found` error does NOT always mean the author did something wrong.** A
fragment authored to be consumed field-by-field through `<mas-field field="...">` (e.g.
a "Headless"/"Promobar" fragment supplying a `callout`, a price, or a `customFields`
string) legitimately has **no variant** — `mas-field` never touches the variant
(`web-components/src/mas-field.js` reads `event.detail.fields` and renders one field; no
`hydrate()`, no template lookup). Only `merch-card` throws `no template found in
payload`. So if a field-only fragment is producing a **`merch-card[...]`** hydration
error, something rendered it as a card that shouldn't have — that is usually **CODE**,
not authoring.

Before you write an AUTHORING verdict for `no template found`, trace how the referer
actually references the id:

1. **Fetch the referer's rendered HTML and its `.plain.html`.** An id absent from
   `.plain.html` but present in the rendered page is **injected by MEP/personalization**
   — look for a `*.json` manifest reference (`action: replace`, `selector`/`all`), and
   read that manifest to find the replacement EDS fragment.
2. **Open the replacement EDS fragment source** (`<host>/<path>.plain.html` on
   `main--<repo>--adobecom.aem.live` or `www.adobe.com`) and grep for the culprit id.
3. **Inspect how the id is referenced.** A Studio link that carries **`&field=<name>`**
   (e.g. `field=callout`, `field=customFields[...]`) is an intended **`mas-field`** — no
   variant needed, and correct authoring. A link with **no `field=`** is a full
   **`merch-card`** and does need a variant.

Milo routes these: `decorateAutoBlock` reroutes a `mas.adobe.com/studio.html` link with
`field=` in the hash to the lightweight `mas-field` path instead of
`merch-card-autoblock` (`libs/utils/utils.js`, the `if (key === 'merch-card-autoblock'
&& url.hash.includes('field='))` branch; landed in **MWPW-202286 / milo PR #6463,
2026-08-30**). If **every** authored reference to the culprit carries `field=` yet the
page still logged a `merch-card` hydration failure, the page was served a **Milo build
predating that reroute** (adobe.com's milo pin lags `main`). Verdict: **CODE / Milo
rollout** — self-heals as the pin advances; confirm `adobe.com/libs/utils/utils.js`
already contains the reroute. No content fix, and **do not** send the author a
"pick a layout" call to action.

## EDS / MEP related resources (for an authoring or MEP verdict)

When the fix lives in Edge Delivery content or a personalization manifest, hand the
owner concrete links, not just prose:

- **The referer page source:** `<referer>.plain.html` — the authored blocks.
- **The MEP manifest** driving the swap: the `*.json` referenced in the rendered page
  (`experiences[].selector` → `experiences[].all`). Cite the exact replacement fragment
  path that injects the culprit.
- **The EDS fragment** that carries the merch link: `<host>/<path>` (rendered) and
  `<host>/<path>.plain.html` (source). Prefer `main--<repo>--adobecom.aem.live`.
- **The card in Studio:** the `#page=fragment-editor&fragmentId=<id>` deep link (above).
- **MEP authoring guide:** https://milo.adobe.com/docs/authoring/features/personalization
  (manifest actions: `replace`, `updateMetadata`, selectors, page filters).
- If the swap targets the wrong fragment or a variation id, the fix is in the **manifest
  row** (change `all`/`selector`), not the card — say which row.

## Decision table

Ground truth for the merch-card messages is `web-components/src/hydrate.js`.

## Output format

**Do the classification and verification with the full technical picture, but tailor
the report to the audience of the verdict.**

### Whenever a human must act (AUTHORING verdict, or the content part of a MIXED one)

**Always** deliver the human call to action as a **Slack-ready message** in one fenced
code block the user can paste as-is. It has three parts: what a person must do, the
cards to fix, and sample pages where the breakage shows.

The reader is a content author, not an engineer. Strip all technical detail — no code
paths, field names, etags, cache/status codes, fragment ids in prose, or internal file
names. Name cards by their Studio **title** (fetch it from the live payload, step 3).

**Slack formatting rules** (the message is pasted into the Slack composer, which does not
parse link markup):

- `*bold*` (single asterisks), `•` bullets, `:emoji:` codes.
- **Plain, full URLs only** — Slack auto-links them. Never `<url|label>` (it pastes
  literally, leaving a stray `|label>` suffix) and never `[label](url)`.
- **One URL per line.** Never chain URLs on one line with `·` or commas; put each on its
  own indented line under its card.
- No `##` headings, no tables, no `**double**` bold.

**Sample pages:** for every card, list the referer pages where its failure was seen,
taken from the export (not guessed). Cross-tab culprit id × referer (strip query
strings); show up to ~5 pages per card, most frequent first, one per line. If several
cards share the same pages, list the pages once in a shared "Pages affected" block
instead of repeating them.

**How to check the fix:** never write "load it from <country>". Give ready-to-click test
URLs that simulate the affected market with the `akamaiLocale` (geo, lowercase) and
`country` (uppercase) query parameters, one per affected market seen in the export
(e.g. `country=IN` → `?akamaiLocale=in&country=IN`, `country=AU` →
`?akamaiLocale=au&country=AU`). Use the top sample page.

https://www.adobe.com/<top-sample-path>?akamaiLocale=<geo>&country=<CC>
<one line per affected market>

Thanks! :pray:

Always include the Studio link for each card: it takes the author straight to the card
that needs fixing. No MWPW code ticket for a pure authoring verdict.

### When the verdict is CODE or MIXED

The reader is an engineer. Include the evidence:

```
## Splunk referer analysis — <referer base URL>
**Window:** <start> → <end> · **Events:** ~<100·N estimated> (raw sample <N>, ~1% sampling ⇒ ±~<1/√N>) · **Severity:** <...> · **Locale(s):** <...>
**Verdict:** CODE | MIXED — <one-line root cause>

### Evidence
- Dominant message: "<msg>" — raw <count>/<N>, est. ~<100·count> occurrences
- Culprit fragment: <id> → https://mas.adobe.com/studio.html#page=fragment-editor&fragmentId=<id>
- Fetch health: <status / cdn / stale / retryCount / etag>
- Suspect area: <io/www, hydrate.js, mas-commerce-service, …>
- Note magnitude is a 1% sampling estimate; low-count secondary messages (raw <~10) are directional only.

### Calls to action
1. <concrete engineering step>
2. Propose a MWPW ticket (offer to run the `mwpw-ticket` skill).
```

For a **MIXED** verdict, follow the engineering report with the Slack-ready author
message above, covering only the content part of the fix.
